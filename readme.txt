Welcome to taskapp

In order to explore the api services: 
- go to src/routes.js to find all the endpoints
- go to the each endpoint controller method to see what happens

Notice that before starting the service you need to:
- have a MongoDB service running locally or provide a valid address in app.js

To start the service run the command:
npm run start

Enjoy!
